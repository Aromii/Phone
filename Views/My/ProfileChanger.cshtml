                                            This is a project mainly responsible for changing the profile such as silent, vibrate,
                                            flight, meeting into general mode through an SMS.  Using this project any people who
                                            have missed or unable to find their mobile can easily access their mobile phone by
                                            sending an SMS from any other mobile. When an SMS is sent to the missed mobile
                                            the profile which is in silent mode automatically gets activated into general mode.
                                            This can be done when the application is installed in the mobile phone.
                                            This type of application is very much useful as security purpose.
